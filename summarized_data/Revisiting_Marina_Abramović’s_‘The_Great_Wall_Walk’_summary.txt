Title: Revisiting Marina Abramović’s ‘The Great Wall Walk’
Summary:
That was until 2010, when Ulay surprised Abramović at the Museum of Modern Art in New York during her performance “The Artist is Present,” in which she sat in front of visitors, one at a time, and held their gaze in silence. Courtesy of the Marina Abramović Archives

The Great Wall, which stretches across northern China, was built to keep out invaders, but for the locals Abramović spoke to, its winding shape was less about military history and more to do with an earthly representation of dragons and the Milky Way, she said. “It is a treasure for a curator, for anyone that is in the business of art, or art history research, (to) document (what has) not been digitized yet but exists there in large quantities.”

Along the way, the artist heard tales from locals about dragons and the folklore surrounding the Great Wall.
