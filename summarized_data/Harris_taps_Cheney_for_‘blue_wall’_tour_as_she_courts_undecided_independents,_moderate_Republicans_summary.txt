Title: Harris taps Cheney for ‘blue wall’ tour as she courts undecided independents, moderate Republicans
Summary:
Harris told reporters Saturday that she and Cheney will “talk with folks about why it’s important for us to put country before party and value the very important foundational principles that we stand on.” Part of that pitch, she said, is “the importance of having a president in the White House who actually understands their job, and is fit to serve.”

Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, brushed off Harris’ upcoming events with Cheney, telling reporters Sunday in Wisconsin that the former congresswoman is “motivated by an obsessive hatred of the people who cost her Wyoming congressional seat.” He was referring to Cheney’s loss to a Trump-backed primary challenger in a 2022 primary, which followed her role on the House committee that investigated Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021. “The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump and I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans, and I take that pledge seriously.”

Harris’ push to court suburban women, in particular, comes as polls show this year’s election could see a historic gender gap — with a clear majority of women backing the Democratic nominee and Trump racking up big margins with men. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential nominations, defended Harris on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, saying she is trying to show that beyond the issues, “there are reasons to vote against Donald Trump.”

“I think what we’re seeing is a coalition of people, more establishment Democrats and progressive Democrats and progressive independents — I’m the longest-serving independent in American history — come together with the goal of defeating a very dangerous candidate, and that is Donald Trump,” he said.
