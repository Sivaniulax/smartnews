Title: Moldova backs joining EU by razor-thin margin as President Sandu condemns ‘assault’ on democracy
Summary:
In an uncharacteristically forceful statement issued late Sunday night, Sandu accused foreign groups of attempting to undermine Moldova’s democratic process and “using the most disgraceful means to keep our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability.”

Sandu said Moldovan authorities had “clear evidence that these criminal groups aimed to buy 300,000 votes – a fraud of unprecedented scale.”

CNN reported last week on the efforts of a Kremlin-linked network, spearheaded by the exiled Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, to buy votes in Moldova, aiming to sway the results of the EU referendum. Sandu, who framed the vote as a choice for the former Soviet country between pursuing its nascent European future or remaining lodged within the Kremlin’s orbit, said the results meant Moldova had won its first difficult battle in its push to join the EU. But as the votes of Moldova’s large and mostly pro-European diaspora began to trickle in from abroad, the “yes” vote crept into the lead in the early hours of Monday morning.
