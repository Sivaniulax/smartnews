Title: Defense Secretary Austin arrives in Ukraine amid Russian gains and imminent US election
Summary:
And we refuse to pretend that appeasement will stop an invasion.”

The senior defense official said the Pentagon is still planning as though the US’ support will continue, and Austin said Friday that “every day, we are building long-term capability to Ukraine.”

“None of us are strangers to political uncertainty in the US, or in Ukraine for that matter,” the defense official said. That is despite the heavy Western sanctions imposed on Russia’s economy in response to its invasion, billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment the US has surged to Ukraine, and the multinational coalitions that the Biden administration rallied from the earliest days of the war to help Ukrainian troops beat back Russian advances. The secretary’s visit was also meant to serve as a moment for him to “step back” and look at the “arc” of the US-Ukraine relationship over the last two and a half years of war, a senior defense official said.
