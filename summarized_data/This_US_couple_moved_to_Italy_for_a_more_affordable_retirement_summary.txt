Title: This US couple moved to Italy for a more affordable retirement
Summary:
â€œWe flew to Italy for the second time in 2023 and put an offer in for that home. According to Tony, his father and grandfather migrated from Italy to the US in 1938 to make a better life for themselves. That same year, the Smarrellis, both of Italian descent, relocated to the picturesque coastal town of Scalea, in the southern Italian region of Calabria.
