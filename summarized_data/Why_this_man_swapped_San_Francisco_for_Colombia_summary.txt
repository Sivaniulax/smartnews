Bennett, who first moved to San Francisco in 2006, explains that he had begun to feel disconnected from his job, as well as the city, and questioned whether he really wanted to spend the rest of his life “in an office working for other people.”

“I wouldn’t quite call it an existential crisis, if you will, but I was getting a lot less fulfillment out of what was in my bank account,” he says. Bennett acknowledges that many of the decisions that he’s made with regards to his career and the destination he lives in have been easier due to the fact that he’s single with no dependents. I’m not going to get mad at you.’”

He goes on to explain that he finds Colombians to be more relaxed in general, and “people don’t really act with the sense of urgency that you might get in America.
