Title: Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs named in 7 new lawsuits; other celebrities allegedly involved
Summary:
“In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman.”

The newest lawsuits, five of which were filed in federal court in New York and two in New York Superior Court on Monday, include allegations of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, battery, or false imprisonment by Combs between 2000 and 2022 in New York, Los Angeles or Las Vegas. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process,” Combs’ attorneys said in the statement. When reached for comment, representatives for Combs referred CNN to a previous statement from his attorneys in which they denied the allegations in six other lawsuits filed last week.
