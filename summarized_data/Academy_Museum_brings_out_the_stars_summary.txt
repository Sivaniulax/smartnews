CNN —

The annual gala for the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures raised both money and the profiles of the many entertainment figures who attended. Mescal told THR his selection, along with Moreno and Tarantino, was “a huge, huge honor.”

“When the offer came in, it’s not something I was expecting and honestly was somewhat reticent because I didn’t understand the context of it, that it was about someone kind of at the infancy of their careers and kind of trying to establish what their career means to them,” said the “Gladiator II” star, who received the Vantage Award. “Mugler 🤍🪽+ Tiffany’s 💎 for the Academy Museum Gala,” reads the caption on a series of photos showing her snatched in a white bustier with a matching coat and stunning jewelry.
