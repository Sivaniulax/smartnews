Title: The cost to women of the overlooked rise of Kenya’s manosphere
Summary:
In a combative 2023 interview, the influencer claimed his controversial views were a “force for good” and that he was acting under the instruction of God to do good things.” While much has been said about the West’s grappling with this issue, what’s often overlooked is the growth and amplification of several other prominent manosphere voices in the Global South, with some countries leading their regions, such as Kenya. CNN carried out an analysis of Kenya’s manosphere between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2024 and found that social media posts using popular terms and language from the manosphere are widespread on platforms such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram all year, averaging more than 4,000 mentions each day on X in 2023. He went on to highlight additional challenges moderating this type of content in Kenya, explaining that the removal of X’s trust and safety team in Africa last year contributed to the scale of the problem today.
