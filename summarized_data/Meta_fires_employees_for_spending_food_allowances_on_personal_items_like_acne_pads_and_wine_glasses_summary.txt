Title: Meta fires employees for spending food allowances on personal items like acne pads and wine glasses
Summary:
The meal vouchers are meant for employees to eat while working at the office — sometimes long hours stretching across several meals of the day, notorious in the tech world. But for employees at smaller offices without food services, the company provides meal vouchers — $20 for breakfast and $25 each for lunch and dinner — so they can have food delivered to the office while on the job. Among those laid off were Jane Manchun Wong, a prominent security researcher who became well known in the tech world for predicting new social media features — like a Facebook resume feature and a tool on the platform formerly known as Twitter that let users hide replies to their tweets — before she was hired by Meta in June 2023 to work on the Instagram and Threads team.
