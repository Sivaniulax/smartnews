Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve said the call “decided the game,” adding the game – and WNBA championship – was “stolen from us.”

“The officials during the game should have a third party because that was not a foul. “And to be able to come in here and do this in a Game 5 at home, it just means the world.”

The new star then hugged her sister as tears started to well up in her eyes.
