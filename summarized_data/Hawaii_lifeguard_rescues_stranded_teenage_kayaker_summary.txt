Title: Hawaii lifeguard rescues stranded teenage kayaker
Summary:
He’s treading water and hanging on to the midsection of the kayak, and I see his head above the water, and I’m like, wait, is he alive?” Keaulana said. “Then I yelled out ‘Kahiau?’ and when he said, ‘Yes,’ super calm, I just broke down crying.”

By the time he was pulled aboard Keaulana’s boat, the 17-year-old had been out in the ocean for nearly 12 hours. “It was the worst night of our lives, followed by the best morning of our lives.”
