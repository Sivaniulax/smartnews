Title: Hurricane Milton’s losses of up to $34 billion could make it one of the costliest storms in US history
Summary:
The lower end of the insured losses estimate from CoreLogic would be $17 billion, with $13 billion of wind damage covered by homeowners and business insurance , and $4 billion of insured flood losses. The upper end of the insured loss estimate, $22 billion in wind damage and $6 billion in flood damage, would be enough to move Milton into the 10th biggest hit to insurers, residents and businesses from a storm, just ahead of the 2008’s Hurricane Ike when adjusted for inflation. Most of Milton’s losses came from wind damage due to the unusual nature of the storm, according to CoreLogic.
