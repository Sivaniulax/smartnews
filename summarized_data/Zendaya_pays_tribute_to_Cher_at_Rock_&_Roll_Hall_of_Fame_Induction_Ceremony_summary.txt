“Thank you Cher,” Zendaya said at the ceremony. And in 2019 Dua Lipa — who performed alongside Cher at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony over the weekend — also wore a replica of the same outfit during a performance in Paris. “Every time (Cher) wore one of those get-ups, it would be in the paper the next day — all over the country,” Mackie said in an interview with Fashionista in 2019.
