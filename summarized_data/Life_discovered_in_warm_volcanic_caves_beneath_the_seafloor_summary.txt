Title: Life discovered in warm volcanic caves beneath the seafloor
Summary:
Instruments such as ice-penetrating radar will study the ocean below the moon’s thick ice shell, and a magnetometer will “sniff” particles released by plumes that rise up through cracks in the frozen surface to analyze the body of water’s composition. Now, the study of deep-sea fauna has led to the discovery of an unexpected ecosystem where life thrives in the most unlikely of places. The finding suggests unique ecosystems on the seafloor and within the subseafloor are connected, allowing life to thrive above and below the ocean bed.
