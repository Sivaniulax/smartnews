Title: AI and robots take center stage at ‘world’s largest tech event’
Summary:
“I think what (was) very exciting this year (was) the focus on AI and deep tech,” said Trixie LohMirmand, executive vice president of Dubai World Trade Centre and CEO at KAOUN International, which organizes the event. And that gives everybody an opportunity to take (market) share from their competitors, build new markets and grow.”

The show, which debuted in 1981 as the Gulf Computer Exhibition in a single hall at the same venue, is now on its 44th edition and this year spanned 40 halls, boasting over 6,500 exhibitors, 1,800 startups and 1,200 investors, with attendees from 180 countries. Next year, Gitex will make its debut in Nigeria, which LohMirmand calls “a future AI superpower.” “It was very interesting and encouraging for us to note that many emerging, rising nations, cities and countries are trying to get into the game of digital transformation, and you can feel the urgency and motivation to accelerate that transformation in as short a time as possible,” she said.
