Title: How a cop-turned-therapist is helping election workers deal with threats and harassment
Summary:
He said Arizona election workers are ready: “We’re a hearty bunch.”

‘We’re seeing people walk away’

Love, the ex-state trooper, began speaking to election officials as a therapist after his friend Tina Barton, a former Republican clerk in the City of Rochester Hills, Michigan, received a death threat in the aftermath of the 2020 election. “It would be naïve to not prepare for the possibility of that reoccurring,” Schmidt said of the threats that he and other election workers received in 2020. US officials are concerned that a belief in voter fraud or other “election-related grievances” could motivate domestic extremists to engage in violence in the weeks before and after the November election, as it did during the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, according to a recent federal intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN.
