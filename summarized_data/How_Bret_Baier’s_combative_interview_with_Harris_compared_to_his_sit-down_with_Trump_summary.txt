Title: How Bret Baier’s combative interview with Harris compared to his sit-down with Trump
Summary:
Baier’s first question to Harris on Wednesday was much more pointed: “How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country in the last three and a half years?”

Harris spoke for 11 seconds before Baier interjected and asked for a specific number. Baier said it was a question submitted by a Trump fan named Erica who asked, “What is the first thing you will do to turn this country around if you get elected?”

Baier then transitioned to more difficult questions for Trump, specifically about the charges that he mishandled classified materials. “And that is this: What do you think is the most important issue facing the country right now?”

Trump spoke for 45 seconds and brought up the economy, the southern border, the military, “woke” politics, and other topics.
