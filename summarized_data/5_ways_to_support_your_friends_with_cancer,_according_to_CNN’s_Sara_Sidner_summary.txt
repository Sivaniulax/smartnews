Title: 5 ways to support your friends with cancer, according to CNN’s Sara Sidner
Summary:
“When you are initially diagnosed and being treated for cancer you do need to know people care about you, but it can stress you out if you feel pressure to respond to every message, letter or email while you navigate the complexities of treatment and your own emotions,” she explained. Reach out, but don’t expect a reply

Do send a text, email or voicemail with a disclaimer such as “You don’t have to respond; I just want you to know I’m here when you need me” or “I love you – that’s the message,” Sidner said via email. “If you’re not sure, you can ask how you can best support them as they are in their cancer journey,” she said via email.
