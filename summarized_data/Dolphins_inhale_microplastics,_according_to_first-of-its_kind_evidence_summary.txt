Coastal dolphins and human health

The authors of the new study hope to do further research on microplastic inhalation in dolphins to understand the types of plastic they are exposed to and potential health risks, Dziobak said. CNN —

For the first time, scientists have found evidence that marine mammals could be inhaling microplastics, according to new research that detected the potentially harmful particles in the breath of bottlenose dolphins off the coasts of Louisiana and Florida. Previous research indicates that microplastics within the ocean are flung into the atmosphere through wave activity, so it’s possible that other marine mammals that breathe at the surface such as dolphins could be exposed to the particles as well, Dziobak said in an email.
