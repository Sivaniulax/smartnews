Title: Origins of humanity’s love of carbs revealed, new study suggests
Summary:
“The authors finding that an increased copy number of the amylase gene, which results in a greater ability to break down starch, may have emerged hundreds of thousands of years before Neanderthals or Denisovans gives more credit to the idea that starches were being metabolized into simple sugars to fuel rapidly growing brain development during human evolution,” Hermes said. The presence of multiple copies of the gene in three human species suggests that it was a trait shared by a common ancestor, before the different lineages split, according to the study. The study “provided compelling evidence” of how the molecular machinery for converting difficult-to-digest starches into easily accessible sugars evolved in humans, said Taylor Hermes, an assistant professor in the department of anthropology at the University of Arkansas, who wasn’t involved in the research.
