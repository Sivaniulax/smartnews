The head of each animal showcases characteristics belonging to both millipedes and centipedes, which suggests that the two types of arthropods are more closely related than previously believed, according to the study authors. We used a combination of microCT (micro-computed tomography) and synchrotron imagery to examine the Arthropleura inside, revealing the fine details of its anatomy.”

The new scans of Arthropleura revealed what the creature's head looked like, including its stalked eyes, mandibles and mouthparts. The team was surprised to uncover that Arthrorpleura had body characteristics seen in modern millipedes, such as two pairs of legs per body segments, as well as the head characteristics of early centipedes, such as the positioning of its mandibles and shape of its feeding apparatus.
