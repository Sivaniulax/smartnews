Title: Lael Wilcox happy to prove doubters wrong with 18,000-mile world record
Summary:
It was an idea that had occurred to her in 2016 as she cycled across the US from Oregon to Virginia as part of the TransAm Bike Race, an event which she would go on to win, becoming the first woman and first American ever to do so. “I was riding faster than I had the whole trip, and I just had this extra energy kind of pulling me to the end.”

Fans were able to track Lael Wilcox's route around the world in real time on Komoot. “I didn’t know what to expect and I was just kind overcome with emotion, like: ‘I did it.’”

Just over a month since it was set, Wilcox’s around-the-world record is already potentially under threat.
