Currently scheduled for the second half of 2026, NASA’s Artemis III mission plans to be the first astronaut moon landing since Apollo 17 in 1972. The suits will be made in a white material able to reflect heat, offering protection from extremely high temperatures and lunar dust, according to a joint press release.
